All tasks are executed in sequential order
Tasks are processed one at a time
Indentation is extremely important
No tabs in yaml file
Use spaces only
Empty lines have no value
File extension is usually .yml or .yaml
No difference between double quotation or no quotation for a task
when a flat file is written in yml format to execute tasks/plays then it is called playbook
